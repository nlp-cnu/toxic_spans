# toxic_spans
This repository contains the work for SemEval 2020 Task 5.

The goal for this task is to create a system that takes text data as input, and outputs a list of character offsets where toxic text is. Toxic Span Detection (TSD)
Ex: 
Input → "This is a stupid example, so thank you for nothing a!@#!@."
Output → [10,11,12,13,14,15,51,52,53,54,55,56]
